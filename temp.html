        <p class="mt-3 fw-light text-center">The reason I choose this page is that I was looking for an internship recently, and I found some of the companies’ career pages were not well designed, so I want to redesign one of them, and make it better (hopefully :) ).</p>

        <h1 class="display-5">Problems</h1>
        <p>I found several problems in the original webpage and want to focus on them during the redesign.</p>

            Accessibility
        </h1>
        <p>After using the WebAIM WAVE, I also detected some possible accessibility problems</p>
        <p>
            There are 6 errors. 2 errors are missing alternative text for pictures so nothing will show up in the image position when images are not successfully loaded. 1 error is the language of the HTML document is missing then some search engines cannot identify which language this document is using.  1 error is the empty heading, maybe the webpage developer just wants to use the title tag to create an empty space. 2 errors are the empty button, the webpage developer didn’t put any value text in the button but used another way to label it and implemented its functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these errors, we can see the webpage is not developed under a good, standard specification. Although maybe everything works as the developer expects now, this webpage still has hidden design problems. I agree with these problems. I don’t think these are big problems, since this is just a career page of a small company, those problems won’t impact the usability. However, these problems may impact visitors’ impression of this company.

        <h1 class="display-5">Low-fidelity Wireframing</h1>
        <p>I create three lo-fi wireframes for the webpage redesign.</p>
        <p>For desktop (and explaination about problems solving)</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="lofidesktop.jpeg" alt="lofidesktop.jpeg"/>
        <p>For tablet and mobile. (Left tablet Right mobile)</p>
        <p>Actually, all problems are solved in the same way here as above desktop wireframe. So didn't make additional annotation here.</p>

        <p>These are three hi-fi prototypes. For clarity, all notations and explanations are included in the first prototypes (desktop screen size) </p>
