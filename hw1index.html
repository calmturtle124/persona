  <h1>Vending Machine</h1>
  <p>Vending machines are very common in our lives. Think back to the last time you used a vending machine and what comes to mind? The item you wanted most was sold out? Money being swallowed or inconvenient to use? Or can't remember anything about it?

      This is a project about vending machines. </p>
    <p>This project will show you my observations of the people who use vending machines, interviews with them, research on vending machine users and on the vending machines themselves. It may be superficial, but hopefully you will get something.</p>

  <h1>Annotated sketch</h1>
    <h3>The snack vending machine allows users to self-purchase snacks by simply paying and entering a serial number on the keyboard. It tries to make snack buying easier.</h3>

    <p>ring: will operate after a successful transaction to drop your item down</p>
    <p>the first "box" at the right of the vending machine: the place to put bills in. Has an instruction “Insert Bill Here”</p>
    <p>the second "box" at the right of the vending machine: A screen to show your process. Has an initial instruction “Press Selection for information” and also shows nine grid keys and a hand. After the user presses the item serial number below the keys, it will show the number the user input, then the money deposit, then a “machine accepts card” instruction. After your card has been accepted, it will show “processing”,
        then “vending” to indicate the current progress.</p>
    <p>the third "box" at the right of the vending machine: A keyboard contains keys from 0 to 9 (for input item serial number), a “*”, a “#”, a key for change, and a “C”.</p>
    <p>the last "box" at the right of the vending machine: A card swiper with a small screen has initial instructions “swipe or tap to begin”, and “accept credit or debit card”. After the swipe or tap, its screen will show “please select your item”.</p>
    <p>the left below box of the vending machine: The place to pick up items. Items will be dropped here.</p>
    <p>the right below box of the vending machine: The place to pick up the change. Change (coins) will be dropped here.</p>
